\begin{enumerate}
\item
From the univariate case (and undergraduate econometrics),
  we know that both estimators are identical;
  hence, the asymptotic normal distribution holds as well.

\item
Taking the derivative of the conditional log-likelihood function with respect to \(\Sigma_u\) yields:
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{\Sigma}_u = \frac{\hat{U}\hat{U}'}{T}
\end{align*}
where \(\hat{U}\) are both the ML and OLS residuals (as \(\widetilde{A}=\widehat{A}\)).
Note that from previous exercises in the univariate case
  we have already seen that the only difference to the OLS estimator of \(\Sigma_u\)
  is given in the fact that for ML we don't correct the degrees of freedom,
  but simply divide by the \textbf{effective} sample size used in the estimation \(T\).

\item
See the previous exercise, as the \texttt{VARReducedForm} function also outputs the ML estimate of \(\Sigma_u\):
