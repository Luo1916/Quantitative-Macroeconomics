\section[Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Laplace AR{(p)}]{Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Laplace AR{(p)}\label{ex:MaximumLikelihoodEstimationLaPlaceARp}}
Consider the AR{(1)} model with constant
\begin{align*}
y_t = c + \phi y_{t-1} + u_t
\end{align*}
Assume that the error terms \(u_t\) are {i.i.d.}\ Laplace distributed with known density
\begin{align*}
f_{u_{t}}(u) = \frac{1}{2} \exp{\left( -|u|\right)}
\end{align*}
Note that for the above parametrization of the Laplace distribution
  we have that \(E(u_t)=0\) and \(Var(u_t)=2\),
  so we are only interested in estimating \(c\) and \(\phi \)
  and not the standard deviation of \(u_t\) as it is fixed to 2.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Derive the log-likelihood function conditional on the first observation.
\item
Write a function that calculates the conditional log-likelihood of \(c\) and \(\phi \).
\item
Load the dataset given in the CSV file \texttt{LaPlace.csv}.
Numerically find the maximum likelihood estimates of \(c\) and \(\phi \)
  by minimizing the negative conditional log-likelihood function.
\item
Compare your results with the maximum likelihood estimate under the assumption of Gaussianity.
That is, redo the estimation by minimizing the negative Gaussian log-likelihood function
  using the dataset given in the CSV file \texttt{LaPlace.csv}.
\end{enumerate}
