For large \(T\) the bootstrap CI are almost identical to the asymptotic CIs, for small \(T\) they are narrower.

No efficiency gain from imposing parametric assumptions even when that assumption is true,
  whereas imposing the wrong parametric structure tends to undermine the accuracy of the bootstrap inference.

\(\hookrightarrow \) Nonparametric approach is typically strictly preferred in practice.
