The Null hypothesis of \textbf{no remaining residual autocorrelation} can be rejected for the AR{(1)} model,
  but not for the AR{(\(\hat{p}\))} model.
This implies that the residuals in the AR{(1)} model are NOT white noise,
  while the residuals in the AR{(\(\hat{p}\))} model are LIKELY to be white noise.
In sum, both the information criteria as well as the Portmanteau test favor the AR{(\(\hat{p}\))} model over the AR{(1)} model.
