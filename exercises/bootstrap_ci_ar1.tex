\section[Bootstrap Confidence Interval For AR{(1)} Coefficient]{Bootstrap Confidence Interval For AR{(1)} Coefficient\label{ex:BootstrapConfidenceIntervalARone}}
Consider the AR{(1)} model with constant
\begin{equation*}
y_{t}=c +\phi y_{t-1}+u_{t}
\end{equation*}
for \(t=1,\ldots ,T\) with iid error terms \(u_{t}\) and \(E(u_{t}|y_{t-1})=0\).
Usually, a \( (1-\alpha)\% \) confidence interval for \( \phi \) is constructed using the normal (or Student's t) approximation:
\begin{gather*}
\left[ \hat{\phi}-z_{\alpha/2}\cdot SE(\hat{\phi});\ \hat{\phi}+z_{1-\alpha/2}\cdot SE(\hat{\phi})\right]
\end{gather*}
with \(\hat{\phi}\) denoting the OLS estimate,
  \(SE(\hat{\phi})\) the estimated standard error of \( \phi \)
  and \(z_{\alpha/2}\) the \(\alpha/2\) quantile of the standard normal distribution (or t-distribution).
If one does not know the asymptotic distribution of a test statistic
  (or it has a very complicated form),
  one often relies on a nonparametric simulation approach.
To this end, we are going to do a so-called \enquote{\emph{bootstrap}},
  i.e.\ we recompute the t-statistics a large number of times on artificial data
  generated from resampled residuals.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
What is a \enquote{Bootstrap approximation}?
Provide insight into the basic idea and possible applications of this statistical technique.

\item
Write a program for the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simulate \(T=100\) observations with \(c=1\), \(\phi=0.8\)
    and errors drawn from e.g.\ the exponential distribution such that \(E(u_t)=0\).
  \item Estimate the model with OLS and calculate the t-statistic
    \(\tau=\frac{\hat{\phi}}{SE(\hat{\phi})}\). 
  \item Store the OLS residuals in a vector
    \(\hat{u} = (\hat{u}_{2},\ldots ,\hat{u}_{T})'\).
  \item Set \(B=10000\) and initialize the output vector
    \(\tau^{\ast} = (\tau_1^\ast,\ldots,\tau_B^\ast)\).
  \item For \( b=1,\ldots,B \):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Draw a sample \textbf{with replacement} from \(\hat{u}\)
      and save it as \(u^{\ast} = u_{2}^{\ast},\ldots ,u_{T}^{\ast }\).
    \item Initialize an artificial time series \( y_t^\ast \) with \(T\) observations
      and set \(y_1^\ast = y_1\).
    \item For \(t=2,\ldots ,T\) generate
    \begin{align*}
    y_{t}^{\ast }=\hat{c}+\hat{\phi}y^\ast_{t-1}+u_{t}^{\ast }
    \end{align*}
    \item On this artificial dataset estimate an AR{(1)} model.
    Denote the estimated OLS coefficient \(\phi^\ast \)
      and corresponding estimated standard deviation \(SE(\phi^\ast)\).
    Store the following t-statistic in your output vector at position \(b\):
    \begin{align*}
    \tau^\ast = \frac{\phi^\ast - \hat{\phi}}{SE(\phi^\ast)}
    \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Sort the output vector such that \(\tau_{(1)}^\ast \leq \cdots \leq \tau_{(B)}^\ast \).
    \item The \enquote{\emph{bootstrap approximate}} confidence interval for \(\phi \) is then given by
    \begin{align*}
    \left[ \hat{\phi}-\tau_{((1-\alpha /2)B)}^{\ast }\cdot SE(\hat{\phi});\ \hat{\phi}-\tau_{((\alpha/2)B)}^{\ast }\cdot SE(\hat{\phi})\right] 
    \end{align*}
    Set \(\alpha=0.05\) and compare this with the normal approximation.
    \item Redo the exercise for \(T=30\) and \(T=10000\). Comment on your findings.
