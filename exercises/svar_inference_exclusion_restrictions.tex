\section[Inference In SVARs Identified By Exclusion Restrictions]{Inference In SVARs Identified By Exclusion Restrictions\label{ex:InferenceExclusionRestrictions}}
Consider an exactly-identified structural VAR model subject to short- and/or long-run restrictions,
  where the structural impulse response of variable \(j\) to structural shock \(k\) at horizon \(h\) is denoted as \(\theta_{jk,h}\),
  which we simply denote as \(\theta \).
We are interested in the distribution of \(\theta \),
  in particular deriving \((1-\gamma)\% \) point-wise confidence intervals given a consistent estimate \(\hat{\theta}\) of \(\theta \).

\begin{enumerate}	
\item Consider the asymptotic confidence intervals which are derived using the delta method:
\begin{align*}
\hat{\theta} \pm z_{\gamma/2} \widehat{std}(\hat{\theta})
\end{align*}
where \(z_{\gamma/2}\) denotes the \(\gamma/2\) percentile of the standard normal distribution
  and \( \widehat{std}(\hat{\theta})\) a consistent estimate of the standard deviation of \(\theta \).
Name the assumptions and shortcomings of this approach.

\item Outline the idea and algorithm of the Standard Residual-Based Recursive-Design Bootstrap approach.

\item Name the central idea underlying the Residual-Based Wild Bootstrap.

\item Discuss the choice of significance level \(\gamma \).

\item Discuss how to draw initial conditions for a resampling method.

\item Given a bootstrap approximation to the distribution of the structural impulse-response function,
  discuss how to construct bootstrap confidence intervals from this distribution.
Particularly, explain
\begin{enumerate}
\item intervals based on bootstrap standard errors
\item Efron's percentile interval
\item equal-tailed percentile-t intervals 		
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
