\section[Theoretical and Simulated Moments]{Theoretical and Simulated Moments\label{ex:TheoreticalAndSimulatedMoments}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the unconditional first two moments (i.e.\ theoretical mean, covariance and autocovariance matrix) of the covariance stationary VAR{(1)} model: \(y_t = \nu + A y_{t-1} + u_t\)
\item Simulate \(R=100\) datasets each with \(T=100\) observations for
\begin{align*}
y_t = \begin{pmatrix}0.2 &0.3 \\-0.6 & 1.1 \end{pmatrix} y_{t-1}  + u_t
\end{align*}
provided that \(u_t \sim WN(0,\Sigma_u)\) and \(\Sigma_u = \begin{pmatrix}0.9 &  \\ 0.2 & 0.5 \end{pmatrix}\).
\item Compute the sample mean and sample covariance matrix for each of the \(R\) datasets. 
Then take the average and compare the results with part (1).
\item How does your choice of \(R\) or \(T\) change your results?

\end{enumerate}

\section{Properties Of Lag-Order Selection Criteria}
Assume that the true Data-Generating-Process (DGP) follows the following VAR{(4)} model
\begin{align*}
y_t = \begin{pmatrix}
2.4 & 1.0\\
0 & 1.1
\end{pmatrix}
y_{t-1}+
\begin{pmatrix}
-2.15 & -0.9\\
0 & -0.41
\end{pmatrix}
y_{t-2}+
\begin{pmatrix}
0.852 & 0.2\\
0& 0.06
\end{pmatrix}
y_{t-3}+
\begin{pmatrix}
-0.126 & 0\\
0 & 0.0003
\end{pmatrix}
y_{t-4}
+ u_t
\end{align*}
where \(u_t\) is a Gaussian white noise with contemporary covariance matrix \(\Sigma_u = \begin{pmatrix}
0.9&0.2\\0.2&0.5
\end{pmatrix}\).

Perform a Monte-Carlo analysis to study both the finite-sample as well as asymptotic properties
  of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC):
\begin{align*}
AIC(m)  &= \log(det(\tilde{\Sigma}_u(m))) + \frac{2}{T}\varphi(m)\\
SIC(m)  &= \log(det(\tilde{\Sigma}_u(m))) + \frac{\log T}{T}\varphi(m)
\end{align*}
where \(\tilde{\Sigma}_u=T^{-1}\sum_{t=1}^T \hat{u}_t\hat{u}_t'\) is the residual covariance matrix estimator
  for a reduced-form VAR model of order $m$ based on OLS residuals \(\hat{u}_t\).
The function \(\varphi(m)\) corresponds to the total number of regressors in the system of VAR equations.
The VAR order is chosen such that the respective criterion is minimized over the possible orders \(m = 0,\ldots,p^{max}\).
To this end, do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Set the number of Monte Carlo repetitions \(R=100\) and \(p^{max}=8\).
\item Initialize output matrices \(aic\) and \(sic\) each of dimension \(R \times 5\).
\item For \(r=1,\ldots,R\) do the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simulate \(10100\) observations for the DGP given above and discard the first 100 observations as burn-in phase.
  Save the remaining 10000 observations in a matrix \(Y\).
  \item Compute the lag criteria for 5 different sample sizes \(T=\{80, 160, 240, 500, 10000\} \),
  i.e.\ use the last \(T\) observations of your simulated data matrix \(Y\) for computations.
  \item Save the chosen lag order in the corresponding output object at position \([r,j]\) where \(j=1,\ldots,5\) indicates the corresponding sample size.
\end{itemize}
\item Look at the frequency tables of your output objects for the different subsamples.
Hint: \texttt{tabulate(aic(:,1))} displays a frequency table for the AIC criterion with sample size equal to 80.
\end{itemize}
Given your results, do you agree with the following (general) findings often found in the literature and textbooks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item AIC is not consistent for the true lag order, whereas SIC is consistent.
\item AIC never (asymptotically) selects a lag order that is lower than the true lag order.
\item In finite samples, we usually have \(\hat{p}_{SIC} \leq \hat{p}_{AIC}\).
\item In finite samples, AIC has a tendency to overestimate the lag order, SIC has a tendency to underestimate the lag order; hence, one should rely on AIC in finite samples.
\end{enumerate}

\section[VAR Estimates on the Impact of Stock-Market Volatility Shocks]{VAR Estimates on the Impact of Stock-Market Volatility Shocks}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Read sections 1 and 2 as well as Appendix A of the paper by \textcite{Bloom_2009_ImpactUncertaintyShocks}.
Focus only on the VAR evidence.
What is the difference between first-moment and second-moment shocks in the context of the paper?

\item What does it mean that \emph{variables are Hodrick-Prescott (HP) detrended (\(\lambda=129,600\))}?

\item Load the data given in the file \texttt{Bloom2009.csv}. Transform the variables as described in the paper.
Plot the transformed variables.

\item Construct the \emph{main stock-market volatility indicator},
  which takes a value of 1 for each of the dates in Table A.1 (Max Volatility) and a 0 otherwise.
Explain the idea behind the construction of this indicator.

\item Estimate the reduced-form VAR(12) model with a constant and time trend.
Compute the Cholesky decomposition of the estimated residual covariance matrix
  and call it \(B_{0}^{-1}\).

\item Explain the identification strategy for the structural VAR model employed in the paper.

\item Use your estimated \(B_{0}^{-1}\) to replicate the point responses (not the dashed error bands) of Figure 2 and Figure 3 of the paper.
Interpret the figures.

\item Replicate the robustness results in Figure A2.
Interpret the results.

\paragraph{Hints:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that the actual dataset spans 1962-7 to 2008-6.
\item In MATLAB the following command computes the HP detrended cyclical component of the logarithm of a series \texttt{X} with \(\lambda=129,600\):\\
\begin{center}\texttt{[\(\sim\),x] = hpfilter(log(X),'Smoothing',129600);}\end{center}
\item MATLAB's \emph{datetime} arrays can be useful to handle dates in order to search for specific dates.
\end{itemize}

\section[Sign-identified Monetary SVAR Model for US]{Sign-identified Monetary SVAR Model for US\label{ex:SignIdentifiedMonetarySVARUS}}
Consider data for \(y_t = (\Delta gnp_t,\Delta p_t,i_t)'\),
  where \(gnp_t\) denotes the log of U.S. real GNP,
  \(p_t\) the consumer price index in logs,
  and \(i_t\) the federal funds rate.
  Data is given in the csv file \texttt{MonPol.csv} containing the sample period of 1970Q1 to 2011Q1.

We will use the following sign restrictions pattern to identify the structural shocks:
\begin{align}
B_0^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
+ & + & -\\
+ & - & -\\
+ & *  & +
\label{eq:signpattern}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
where \(*\) denotes an unrestricted value.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the short summary paper by \textcite{Wolf_2022_WhatCanWe} and provide economic intuition for the pattern given in equation \eqref{eq:signpattern}.
\item Write a script that estimates the structural impulse response function via sign restrictions.
To this end:
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate a VAR{(4)} model with constant by using ordinary least-squares.
Compute the lower Cholesky decomposition of your estimated residual covariance matrix, i.e.\ \( P = chol(\hat{\Sigma}_u) \).
\item Set the IRF horizon \(H=20\) and the number of required sign-identified draws to \(N=1000\).
\item Initialize an array \texttt{IRFvals} of dimension
(i) number of variables \(K\) by (ii) number of shocks \(K\) by (iii) horizon \(H\) by (iv) number of draws \(N\).
This array will store \(n=1,\ldots,N\) sign-identified impulse response functions \(\theta_{jkhn}\) for variable \(j=1,\ldots,K\)
  with respect to shock \(k=1,\ldots,K\) at horizon \(h=0,\ldots,H\), where \(K\) is the number of variables.

\item Initialize \texttt{n=1} and write a while loop that executes the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Draw an orthogonal rotation matrix \(Q\) using the function \texttt{drawRotationMatrixQ.m} in the appendix.
  \item Compute the implied rotated impact matrix \(\widetilde{B}_0^{-1}=PQ\).
  \item Note that \(\widetilde{B}_0^{-1}\) is a valid impact matrix, because \(\hat{\Sigma}_u = \widetilde{B}_0^{-1} \widetilde{B}_0^{-1'}\).
  However, we will only accept those impact matrices \(\widetilde{B}_0^{-1}\) that full-fill the sign restrictions in equation~\eqref{eq:signpattern}.
  Therefore, use if statements to check whether \(\widetilde{B}_0^{-1}\) is a valid impact matrix:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If the pattern is correct, increase \(n\) by 1 and compute the implied IRFs. Store these into \texttt{IRFvals(:,:,:,n)}.
    \item If the pattern is incorrect, don't change the value of \(n\), discard this draw and go back to the beginning of the loop.
  \end{itemize}
  \item End the while loop if \texttt{n=N}.
\end{itemize}
\item Plot \textbf{ALL} \(N\) impulse response functions that full-fill the sign pattern for (i) the level of GDP, (ii) CPI inflation and (iii) the Federal Funds rate.
\\Hint: The graphs should look similar to figure~\ref{fig:signSVAR} in the appendix.
That is, in each subplot compute and plot \texttt{IRFS = squeeze(IRFvals(ivar,ishock,1:nsteps,:))}.	
\end{itemize}

\item Interpret the findings in Figure~\ref{fig:signSVAR}.
\end{enumerate}
