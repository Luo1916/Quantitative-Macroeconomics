\section{Properties Of Lag-Order Selection Criteria}
Assume that the true Data-Generating-Process (DGP) follows the following VAR{(4)} model
$$y_t = \begin{pmatrix}
2.4 & 1.0\\
0 & 1.1
\end{pmatrix}
y_{t-1}+
\begin{pmatrix}
-2.15 & -0.9\\
0 & -0.41
\end{pmatrix}
y_{t-2}+
\begin{pmatrix}
0.852 & 0.2\\
0& 0.06
\end{pmatrix}
y_{t-3}+
\begin{pmatrix}
-0.126 & 0\\
0 & 0.0003
\end{pmatrix}
y_{t-4}
+ u_t$$
where $u_t$ is a Gaussian white noise with contemporary covariance matrix $\Sigma_u = \begin{pmatrix}
0.9&0.2\\0.2&0.5
\end{pmatrix}$.

Perform a Monte-Carlo analysis to study both the finite-sample as well as asymptotic properties of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC):
\begin{align*}
AIC(m)  &= \log(det(\tilde{\Sigma}_u(m))) + \frac{2}{T}\varphi(m)\\
SIC(m)  &= \log(det(\tilde{\Sigma}_u(m))) + \frac{\log T}{T}\varphi(m)
\end{align*}
where $\tilde{\Sigma}_u=T^{-1}\sum_{t=1}^T \hat{u}_t\hat{u}_t'$ is the residual covariance matrix estimator for a reduced-form VAR model of order $m$ based on OLS residuals $\hat{u}_t$. The function $\varphi(m)$ corresponds to the total number of regressors in the system of VAR equations. The VAR order is chosen such that the respective criterion is minimized over the possible orders $m = 0,...,p^{max}$. To this end, do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Set the number of Monte Carlo repetitions $R=100$ and $p^{max}=8$.
	\item Initialize output matrices $aic$ and $sic$ each of dimension $R \times 5$. 
	\item For $r=1,...,R$ do the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Simulate $10100$ observations for the DGP given above and discard the first 100 observations as burn-in phase. Save the remaining 10000 observations in a matrix $Y$.
		\item Compute the lag criteria for 5 different sample sizes $T=\{80, 160, 240, 500, 10000\}$, i.e. use the last $T$ observations of your simulated data matrix $Y$ for computations.
		\item Save the chosen lag order in the corresponding output object at position $[r,j]$ where $j=1,...,5$ indicates the corresponding sample size.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Look at the frequency tables of your output objects for the different subsamples. Hint: \texttt{tabulate(aic(:,1))} displays a frequency table for the AIC criterion with sample size equal to 80.
\end{itemize}
Given your results, do you agree with the following (general) findings?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item AIC is not consistent for the true lag order, whereas SIC is consistent.
	\item AIC never (asymptotically) selects a lag order that is lower than the true lag order.
	\item In finite samples, we usually have $\hat{p}_{SIC} \leq \hat{p}_{AIC}$.
	\item In finite samples, AIC has a tendency to overestimate the lag order, SIC has a tendency to underestimate the lag order; hence, one should rely on AIC in finite samples.
\end{enumerate}

\section{How Well Does the IS-LM Model Fit Postwar US Data?}
Consider a quarterly model for $y_t = (\Delta gnp_t, \Delta i_t, i_t-\Delta p_t, \Delta m_t - \Delta p_t)'$,
  where $gnp_t$ denotes the log of GNP, $i_t$ the nominal yield on three-month Treasury Bills,
  $\Delta m_t$ the growth in M1 and $\Delta p_t$ the inflation rate in the CPI.
There are four shocks in the system: an aggregate supply (AS), a money supply (MS), a money demand (MD) and an aggregate demand (IS) shock.
Ignoring the lagged dependent variables for \textbf{expository} purposes ($B_1=...=B_p=0$),
  the unrestricted structural VAR model can be simply written as $B_0 y_t = \varepsilon_t$. That is:
\begin{align}
\Delta gnp_t &= -b_{12}\Delta i_t -b_{13}(i_t-\Delta p_t) -b_{14}(\Delta m_t-\Delta p_t) + \varepsilon_t^{AS} \label{eq:AS}\\
\Delta i_t &= -b_{21}\Delta gnp_t -b_{23}(i_t-\Delta p_t) -b_{24}(\Delta m_t-\Delta p_t) + \varepsilon_t^{MS} \label{eq:MS}\\
i_t - \Delta p_t &= -b_{31}\Delta gnp_t -b_{32}\Delta i_t -b_{34}(\Delta m_t-\Delta p_t) + \varepsilon_t^{MD} \label{eq:MD}\\
\Delta m_t - \Delta p_t &= -b_{41}\Delta gnp_t -b_{42}\Delta i_t - b_{43} (i_t-\Delta p_t) + \varepsilon_t^{IS} \label{eq:IS}
\end{align}
where $b_{ij}$ denotes the $ij$th element of $B_0$.
Consider the following identification restrictions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Money supply shocks do not have contemporaneous effects on output growth, i.e.
	$$\frac{\partial \Delta gnp_t}{\partial \varepsilon_t^{MS}}=0$$	
	\item Money demand shocks do not have contemporaneous effects on output growth, i.e.
	$$\frac{\partial \Delta gnp_t}{\partial \varepsilon_t^{MD}}=0$$	
	\item Monetary authority does not react contemporaneously to changes in the price level.\\Hint: compute
	$$\frac{\partial \Delta i_t}{\partial \Delta p_t}=0$$
	from equation \eqref{eq:MS}.
	\item Money supply shocks, money demand shocks and aggregate demand shocks do not have long-run effects on the log of real GNP:	
	$$\frac{\partial gnp_t}{\partial \varepsilon_t^{MS}}=0,\qquad \frac{\partial gnp_t}{\partial \varepsilon_t^{MD}}=0,\qquad \frac{\partial gnp_t}{\partial \varepsilon_t^{IS}}=0$$	
	\item The structural shocks are uncorrelated with covariance matrix $E(\varepsilon_t \varepsilon_t')=\Sigma_\varepsilon$.
	In other words, the variances are \textbf{not} normalized.
\end{itemize}
Solve the following exercises:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Derive the implied exclusion restrictions on the matrices $B_0$, $B_0^{-1}$ and $\Theta(1)$.
	\item Consider the data given in the csv file \texttt{gali1992.csv}.
	Estimate a VAR{(4)} model with constant term.
	\item Estimate the structural impact matrix using a nonlinear equation solver,
	  i.e. the objective is to find the unknown elements of $B_0^{-1}$ and the diagonal elements of $\Sigma_\varepsilon$ such that
	$$\begin{bmatrix}
	vech(B_0^{-1} \Sigma_\varepsilon B_0^{-1'}-\hat{\Sigma}_u)\\
	\text{short-run restrictions on }B_0 \text{ and } B_0^{-1} \\
	\text{long-run restrictions on }\Theta(1)\\
	\end{bmatrix}$$
	is minimized.
	Normalize the shocks such that the diagonal elements of $B_0^{-1}$ are positive.
	\item Use the implied estimates of $B_0^{-1}$ and $\Sigma_\varepsilon$ to plot the structural impulse responses functions
	for (i) real GNP, (ii) the yield on Treasury Bills, (iii) the real interest rate and (iv) real money growth.
\end{enumerate}

\section[Sign-identified Monetary SVAR Model for US]{Sign-identified Monetary SVAR Model for US\label{ex:SignIdentifiedMonetarySVARUS}}
Consider data for $y_t = (\Delta gnp_t,\Delta p_t,i_t)'$,
  where $gnp_t$ denotes the log of U.S. real GNP,
  $p_t$ the consumer price index in logs,
  and $i_t$ the federal funds rate.
  Data is given in the csv file \texttt{MonPol.csv} containing the sample period of 1970Q1 to 2011Q1.

We will use the following sign restrictions pattern to identify the structural shocks:
\begin{align}
B_0^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
	+ & + & -\\
	+ & - & -\\
	+ & *  & +
	\label{eq:signpattern}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
where $*$ denotes an unrestricted value.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the short summary paper by \textcite{Wolf_2022_WhatCanWe} and provide economic intuition for the pattern given in equation \eqref{eq:signpattern}.
\item Write a script that estimates the structural impulse response function via sign restrictions.
To this end:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Estimate a VAR{(4)} model with constant by using ordinary least-squares.
	Compute the lower Cholesky decomposition of your estimated residual covariance matrix, i.e. $P=chol(\hat{\Sigma}_u)$.
	\item Set the IRF horizon $H=20$ and the number of required sign-identified draws to $N=1000$.
	\item Initialize an array \texttt{IRFvals} of dimension
	(i) number of variables $K$ by (ii) number of shocks $K$ by (iii) horizon $H$ by (iv) number of draws $N$.
	This array will store $n=1,...,N$ sign-identified impulse response functions $\theta_{jkhn}$ for variable $j=1,...,K$
	with respect to shock $k=1,...,K$ at horizon $h=0,...,H$, where $K$ is the number of variables.
	
	\item Initialize \texttt{n=1} and write a while loop that executes the following steps:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Draw an orthogonal rotation matrix $Q$ using the function \texttt{drawRotationMatrixQ.m} in the appendix.
		\item Compute the implied rotated impact matrix $\widetilde{B}_0^{-1}=PQ$.
		\item Note that $\widetilde{B}_0^{-1}$ is a valid impact matrix, because $\hat{\Sigma}_u = \widetilde{B}_0^{-1} \widetilde{B}_0^{-1'}$.
		However, we will only accept those impact matrices $\widetilde{B}_0^{-1}$ that fullfill the sign restrictions in equation \eqref{eq:signpattern}.
		Therefore, use if statements to check whether $\widetilde{B}_0^{-1}$ is a valid impact matrix:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If the pattern is correct, increase $n$ by 1 and compute the implied IRFs. Store these into \texttt{IRFvals(:,:,:,n)}.
			\item If the pattern is incorrect, don't change the value of $n$, discard this draw and go back to the beginning of the loop.
			\end{itemize}
		\item End the while loop if \texttt{n=N}.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Plot \textbf{ALL} $N$ impulse response functions that fullfill the sign pattern for (i) the level of GDP, (ii) CPI inflation and (iii) the Federal Funds rate.
	\\Hint: The graphs should look similar to figure \ref{fig:signSVAR} in the appendix.
	That is, in each subplot compute and plot \texttt{IRFS = squeeze(IRFvals(ivar,ishock,1:nsteps,:))}.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
